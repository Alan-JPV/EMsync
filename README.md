## Problem Statement :
Kerala’s emergency medical services hold immense promise but operate without advanced machine learning and IoT capabilities, leading to critical delays and suboptimal coordination. Today’s system relies on manual calls, siloed data, and static routing, which:
- Fragment patient information—ambulances arrive without timely vitals or severity insights, hindering hospital preparation.
- Obscure resource availability—real-time ICU bed status and specialist coverage remain unknown, forcing crews into repeated phone tag.
- Miss opportunities for proactive care—without AI-driven triage or predictive analytics, it couldn’t help hospitals prepare services to provide a proper emergency care.
- Waste precious time on rigid routes—traffic congestion and emergencies demand dynamic rerouting that static GPS cannot provide.

## Solution :
EMSYNC (EMsync: Emergency Coordination Hub) is an integrated digital platform designed to modernize and streamline emergency healthcare in India. Its main goal is to eliminate delays, miscommunication, and resource wastage during medical emergencies. EMSYNC aims to ensure every critically ill patient gets the right care, in the right place, as quickly as possible.
Core Objectives:
- Prediction of emergency severity using AI/ML models
- Booking of Emergency Services for smarter resource allocation
- Smart, automated ambulance routing based on traffic .
- IoT-based streaming of live patient vitals from ambulance to prepare hospital staff.
- Comprehensive dashboard for hospitals and EMS teams
- Secure, role-based access with data privacy and compliance
